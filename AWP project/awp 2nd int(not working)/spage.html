<h1><b>The Night Sky</b></h1>
      <p align="left">
        The term night sky, usually associated with astronomy from Earth, refers to the nighttime appearance of celestial objects like stars, planets, and the Moon, which are visible in a clear sky between sunset and sunrise, when the Sun is below the horizon.<br>

Natural light sources in a night sky include moonlight, starlight, and airglow, depending on location and timing. <br><br>Aurorae light up the skies above the polar circles.<br> Occasionally, a large coronal mass ejection from the Sun or simply high levels of solar wind may extend the phenomenon toward the Equator.<br>

The night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. <br>In the past, for instance, farmers have used the status of the night sky as a calendar to determine when to plant crops.<br> Many cultures have drawn constellations between stars in the sky, using them in association with legends and mythology about their deities.<br>

The anciently developed belief of astrology is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on Earth.<br> The scientific study of celestial objects visible at night takes place in the science of observational astronomy.<br>

The visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by light pollution.<br> The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of ambient brightness.<br> With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky.<br> Optical filters and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for optimal views, both professional and amateur astronomers seek locations far from urban skyglow.<br>
